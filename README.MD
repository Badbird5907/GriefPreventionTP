# GriefPreventionTP

### This plugin is now *open source*, but please consider supporting me by [purchasing the plugin on SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/griefpreventiontp.102521/), or [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/Badbird5907)

## What is this?
This is a plugin that allows players to teleport to their claims in [GriefPrevention](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/griefprevention.1884/). Claims can be made public, which allows other players to teleport to them.

## Support
If you have purchased the plugin, please join my [discord server](https://discord.badbird.dev/) and ask in #gptp. I will only provide support to those who have purchased the plugin on [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/griefpreventiontp.102521/).
